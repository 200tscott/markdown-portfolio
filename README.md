# Markdown Portfolio

### Introduction

One of the major things we'll be working towards this term (and during your whole time here) is having a great portfolio page for you. The first step to this is content--what should go in our portfolio? We'll start figuring that out today, as well as continuing to practice our markdown-git-bash triumvirate of tools.


### Setup

We'll be submitting this as a REPL, but feel absolutely free to write the code in VS Code instead if you prefer that and have access to it.

How to set up your REPL:
1. Press the "New REPL" button on [REPL.it](https://www.repl.it).
2. Choose "JS/HTML/CSS".
3. Create a new file using the icon of a file wit ha plus simbol (in the upper left of the interface).
4. Call it whatever you want, but make SURE you end it with a `.md`.
5. Get Markdowning!


### Requirements

1. At least one link. This could be to your GitHub user page, to your LinkedIn, to your Twitter account, or some other resource that represents you to the world.
2. At least one picture. Make sure it's [SFW](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Not_safe_for_work), but otherwise, anything goes!
3. At least one bullet point list.
4. At least one numbered list.


### Contents

You want to be building towards a portfolio here, but because this is a process, please do not get paralyzed by indecision. We'll be editing this as we go throughout this term!
What a portfolio actually _contains_ depends on the person. Has design been your main focus? A gallery would be perfect here. Do you have a background either in code or somewhere that might lead to a code-related job, like sales, or teaching, or management? You might want to highlight that experience with a more resume-like portfolio. Do you have some projects, code or code-related, that you've worked on? A selection of projects (with links!) might be a good choice.

You can do any combination of this, of course!


### Goals

* Have _at least_ one full page of content.
* Use markdown wherever possible.
* Get some practice with your text editing.
